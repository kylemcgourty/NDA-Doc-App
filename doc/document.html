  NON-DISCLOSURE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AGREEMENT
  This Agreement is between {{doc.proprietor}} (“OWNER”); and {{doc.recipient}}.
  WHEREAS, OWNER has developed through substantial effort, research, time, and expense certain
  inventions, design concepts, methodologies, technical know-how, copyrightable material and trade secrets
  directed and related to {{doc.IP}} (“INFORMATION”);
  WHEREAS, OWNER desires to disclose the INFORMATION on a confidential basis to RECIPIENT
  solely for the purposes of evaluating the INFORMATION for possible future business arrangements; and
  WHEREAS, OWNER wishes to maintain the confidentiality of the INFORMATION and the
  protection of OWNER'S intellectual property rights.
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, and conditions contained
  herein, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
  I. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
  A. OWNER agrees to disclose INFORMATION to RECIPIENT to facilitate possible future business
  dealings between the parties.
  B. RECIPIENT agrees to receive such INFORMATION and to refrain from copying, disclosing,
  using, selling, or offering for sale any and all of said INFORMATION, other than at the request of
  OWNER, with the exceptions as provided in paragraph C herein. RECIPIENT agrees to keep
  confidential and refrain from disclosing any and all of the INFORMATION, and to take all
  necessary and reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of any and all of
  the INFORMATION.
  C. Notwithstanding paragraph B, RECIPIENT shall not be liable for disclosure or use of
  INFORMATION only if, and only to the extent that, said INFORMATION was in the public
  domain at the time it was disclosed by OWNER, or was known to and recorded in writing by
  RECIPIENT prior to the time of disclosure by OWNER, or is received from a third party or passes
  into the public domain without breach of this Agreement. With respect to any
  INFORMATION known by RECIPIENT prior to the time of disclosure by OWNER that
  RECIPIENT believes to constitute the INFORMATION, or any portion thereof, RECIPIENT
  shall disclose to OWNER an adequate written description of the INFORMATION within
  fourteen (14) days of the disclosure by OWNER.
  D. This is not an offer for sale or license. No right or license is granted by OWNER to RECIPIENT
  in connection with the technical information or inventions disclosed under this agreement. All
  documents or materials constituting the INFORMATION and all reproductions thereof shall at
  all times remain the sole property of OWNER and shall promptly be returned by RECIPIENT
  upon request.
  E. This Agreement shall remain in force in spite of disclosure of the INFORMATION by OWNER in
  the form of patent applications, copyright applications, or other disclosures by OWNER.

  data files of any documents containing confidential information of OWNER; and

  confidential information of OWNER.
  B. RECIPIENT further agrees, at the request of OWNER:
  1. To immediately return to OWNER all of the items in the possession of RECIPIENT which

  information of OWNER.
  III. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
  A. Title and Copyright Assignment
  1. All products and results of RECIPIENT’S services rendered hereunder (the "Work") are
  works made for hire. RECIPIENT acknowledges and agree that the Work (and all rights
  therein, including, without limitation, copyrights) belongs to and shall be the sole and
  exclusive property of OWNER.
  2. Not withstanding the foregoing, RECIPIENT also hereby assigns and transfers to
  OWNER, its successors and assigns, the entire right, title, and interest in and to all
  copyrights in the Work; all registrations and copyright applications relating thereto and all
  renewals and extensions thereof; all works based upon, derived from, or incorporating the
  Work; all income, royalties, damages, claims and payments now or hereafter due or payable
  with respect thereto; all causes of action, either in law or in equity for past, present, or
  future infringement based on the copyrights; and all rights corresponding to the foregoing
  throughout the world.
  3. If the Work is one to which the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 106A apply, RECIPIENT
  hereby waives and appoints OWNER to assert on RECIPIENT’S behalf RECIPIENT’S moral
  rights or any equivalent rights regarding the form or extent of any alteration to the Work
  (including, without limitation, removal or destruction) or the making of any derivative
  works based on the Work, including, without limitation, photographs, drawings or other
  visual reproductions or the Work, in any medium, for OWNER'S purposes.
  4. RECIPIENT agrees to execute all papers and to perform such other proper acts as OWNER
  may deem necessary to secure for OWNER or its designee the rights herein assigned.
  B. Patent Assignment
  1. RECIPIENT may invent new, original, and ornamental or useful inventions in the course
  of or related to RECIPIENT’S business relationship with OWNER ("the Inventions").
  2. RECIPIENT hereby assigns and/or transfers to OWNER, its successors or assigns,
  the entire right, title, and interest in and to said Inventions, and any patent and
  patent applications deriving there from for any such invention in the United States and 
  3
  throughout the world, including the right to file foreign applications directly in the name
  of OWNER and to claim for any such foreign applications any priority rights to which such
  applications are entitled under international conventions, treaties, or otherwise; and to
  cooperate with OWNER as may be necessary or desirable for obtaining, sustaining,
  reissuing, or enforcing said patent or patent applications in the United States and
  throughout the world for said Inventions, and for perfecting, recording, or maintaining
  any such title in OWNER.
  3. Notwithstanding the above, RECIPIENT shall not assign and/or transfer any invention
  for which no confidential information of OWNER was used, unless the invention
  results from any work performed by RECIPIENT for OWNER.

  prosecute or in any way aid in the institution or prosecution of any claim, demand, action, or cause of action
  arising out of the INFORMATION or any INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY thereof, including but not limited to,
  claim, demand, action, or cause of action for invalidating any INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY of OWNER.
  V. DAMAGES AND SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
  RECIPIENT agrees that should RECIPIENT breach any of the promises contained in this Agreement
  that OWNER would suffer irreparable harm and OWNER would be without adequate remedy at law and that
  OWNER may obtain injunctive relief, including specific performance of the Agreement, as well as monetary
  award for damages suffered by OWNER for RECIPIENT’S breach of this Agreement.
  VI. NO WAIVER
  Failure at any time to require performance of any of the provisions herein shall not waive or diminish a
  party's right thereafter to demand compliance therewith or with any other provision. Waiver of any default
  shall not waive any other default. A party shall not be deemed to have waived any rights hereunder unless such
  waiver is in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of the party making such waiver.
  VII. SEVERABILITY
  Should a court of competent jurisdiction find that any portion of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or
  unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and the parties shall use reasonable
  efforts to substitute a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that implements purposes of the provision so held
  invalid, illegal, or unenforceable to any extent permissible under the law.
